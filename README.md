I have tried to use 3 differnet regression model.
first i have used multiple linear regression, but even after many backward elimination i am not getting good prediction.
Second, i clubbed polynomial regression with multiple linear regression and i am getting prediction of 86 % almost.
I also tried using random forest , which is givine me same 86% almost.
In this repository i am putting all three codes.
